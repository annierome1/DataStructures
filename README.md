# Advanced Data Structures

This repository contains two programs demonstrating the application of advanced data structures to parse and manipulate text files.

## Overview

### Program 1: String Search
This program implements several string search algorithms, allowing users to search for specific strings in a text file using the following methods:

- **Linked List Search**
- **Brute Force Search**
- **Boyer-Moore Algorithm**
- **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm**

To execute the program, run the **Main** class for this module.

### Program 2: Tree Operations
This program compares the performance of tree-based data structures using two datasets:
- A **sorted** text file.
- An **unsorted** text file.

The following operations are performed:
- **Tree Building**: Measures the time required to construct the tree.
- **Book Search**: Times how long it takes to find a specific book in the tree.
- **Book Removal**: Evaluates the time taken to remove a book from the tree.

To execute the program, run the **Main** class for this module.
